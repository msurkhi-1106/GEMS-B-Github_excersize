For this exercise, we have used 4 different sorting methods to sort an array of integers. The four features we have implemented are as follows:

#### Quick Sort
#### Insertion Sort
#### Bubble Sort
#### Heap Sort

We have also used JUnit tests to test my code to check whether the desired output is displayed, and both tests were successful, as can be seen in the video.

Each feature has a branch, plus the master branch which is this one. Read the README.md files from each branch to learn more about the features and how to use it.
